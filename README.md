# Architecture
The VIPER architecture is used in this app, which consists of the following components:

View: Responsible for displaying information to the user and capturing user input.
Interactor: Contains the business logic for fetching and manipulating data.
Presenter: Translates data from the Interactor into a format that can be displayed by the View.
Entity: Represents the data model, in this case, the to-do items.
Router: Handles navigation between screens.

# Database
SQLite is used as the database to store the to-do items. The database is managed using the SQLite.swift library.
